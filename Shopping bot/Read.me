Automated shopping bot(Used to simulate making purchases online, using Python and Selenium)

This is a shopping made around BestBuy. Once the desired item and user information is added, the bot 
can carry out purchases. It is perfect for buying items that are usually out of stock as it's built to continuously check for that item 
until it is ready and will most certainly complete the purchase faster than any human input. It's great if you are a scalper or just eager for an item.
